## Project Overview

This academic research project investigates and compares the performance of selected **2D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** algorithms implemented on **wheeled mobile robots** using the **Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2)**. The study further integrates these SLAM techniques with autonomous navigation algorithms to evaluate their practical applicability and efficiency in real-world scenarios.

---

## Objectives

- To implement and evaluate multiple 2D SLAM algorithms within the ROS2 environment.
- To integrate these SLAM methods with the **ROS2 Nav2** navigation stack.
- To analyze and compare performance based on criteria such as:
  - Mapping accuracy
  - Localization robustness
  - Real-time computational efficiency
