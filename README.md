## Objective

This project aims to **compare the performance of various 2D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms** on wheeled mobile robots using the **ROS2 Jazzy** middleware. The selected SLAM methods are integrated with autonomous navigation systems to evaluate their real-world usability, accuracy, and computational efficiency.

## Research Scope

The project investigates and implements the following:

- **SLAM Algorithms**
  - GMapping SLAM  
  - Hector SLAM  
  - Cartographer SLAM  
  - NanoSLAM  

- **Autonomous Navigation**
  - Integration with **ROS2 Nav2**
  - Path planning and obstacle avoidance

- **Real-Time Evaluation**
  - Performance testing in simulated and physical environments  
  - Metrics: mapping accuracy, CPU usage, localization stability
