## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to **compare the performance of various 2D SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms** on wheeled mobile robots using the **ROS2 Jazzy** middleware. The selected SLAM methods are integrated with autonomous navigation systems to evaluate their real-world usability, accuracy, and computational efficiency.
